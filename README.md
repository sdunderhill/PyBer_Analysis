# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview

In this module I analyzed ridesharing data from Pyber. I looked specifically at city type, ride count, and fares. I needed to show visualizations of the data from PyBer to improve access to ride-sharing services and to determine it's affordability to neighborhoods that are underserved. I created charts showing how city type (urban, suburban, or rural) and number of drivers affected fare price and total number of rides. For the final challenge from V. Isualize I created a summary of all the ride-sharing data by city type. I then created a multi-line graph showing weekly totals of fares for each city within the dates of January 1, 2019 and April 29, 2019.

## Results

When it comes to total rides, Urban won out by at least 2.5 times more than suburban and 13 times more than rural. Urban also had more drivers by almost 5 times more than suburban and almost 31 times more than rural. This information correlates with urban winning out on total fares. Urban grossed $39,854.38. With suburban following with $19,356.33 and rural with $4,327.93. However, the average fare per ride was highest in rural cities with an average fare of $34.62. Correlating with that information, the average fare per driver was highest in rural as well with an average fare of $55.49.

## Summary

The data shows that urban cities make up most of PyBer's revenue. This is due to the larger use and more drivers. I would recommend that more information is analyzed about population, need, and distance of each ride. One can assume that the vast difference in revenue is due to population and need. However, without further analysis it can't be determined how to market to those communities needs. The distance for each ride could be a factor. I would suggest looking into the difference in cost per mile versus the distances of the average ride. If there is a way for the cost to come down in rural and suburban communities, the demand might increase.
